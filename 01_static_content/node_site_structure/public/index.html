        <h2>Root Directory</h2>
        <p>
          The root directory is the starting point for the project. It typically
          contains "meta-files" that describe what should be included in the
          project and how other tools should interact with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will almost always see see a <code>.gitignore</code> file. This
          defines which files should not go into the Git repository.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Server</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>server</code> directory contains the Express server
          application. There is no hard rule that it must be called "server";
          you may see it called "app", "lib", or "bin"
        </p>
        <h3>package.json</h3>
        <p>
          Every Node.js project must have a <code>package.json</code> file. This
          file tells Node things like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Which is the starting file for the program?</li>
          <li>What should the package (program) that we wrote be named?</li>
          <li>What other packages does our program use?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you run the <code>npm install</code> command form a directory
          that contains a package.json file it uses this file to figure out what
          packages and third-party libraries need to be installed. These are
          called <em>dependencies</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Installed dependencies go in a <code>node_modules</code> directory.
          This should always be ignored in the .gitignore file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The install command also creates a
          <code>package-lock.json</code> file. This is used to track the
          specific versions of each package that are used.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Public</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>public</code> directory contains static assets (files) that
          will be served by the web server: the html pages, css, and javascript
          files that are returned to the client.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>
          As projects get more complex, you will see many other subdirectories
          that help keep the project organized.
